# Run brain.py to start the bot

You need:

- Numpy

- Pyperclip

- Pyautogui

- Keyboard

- CV2

The bot will look for the @ symbol relating to users twitter handles. It will hover over it and see if their follower/following count is a sufficient ratio to follow them.

The pictures might be different than whats on your screen, same with the amount of pixels the mouse moves, so this definitely isn't the best method, but it works okay.
